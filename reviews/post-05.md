# Post 05 Review Notes

## Scope

- Post: 05
- Profiles reviewed: smoke and full
- Current status: controlled scalar-volume pressure/cell diagnostic workflow,
  committed smoke/full outputs, notebook, full-profile diagnostic figure,
  hidden website draft, and self-review artifact are in place; final prose and
  rendered page snapshots are still pending.

## Commands

- `uv run kups-tutorial run 05 --profile smoke`
- `uv run kups-tutorial verify 05 --profile smoke`
- `uv run kups-tutorial run 05 --profile full`
- `uv run kups-tutorial verify 05 --profile full`
- `uv run python scripts/generate_post05_figures.py`
- `uv run jupyter execute notebooks/post-05-barostats.ipynb --inplace`
- `uv run pytest -q`
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `git diff --check`
- `python3 scripts/validate_blog.py` in `../sungsoo-ahn.github.io`

## Code And Reproducibility Review

- Configs are committed under `configs/post-05/`.
- Smoke and full outputs are committed under `results/post-05/`.
- The workflow uses a deterministic scalar-volume Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model with
  known NPT-like volume and pressure fluctuation targets.
- The manifest records config hash, Git revision, Python/platform metadata, and
  kUPS/NumPy versions.
- `kups-tutorial run`, `verify`, and `run-all` include post 05.
- The notebook imports reusable logic from `src/kups_md_tutorials/` rather than
  duplicating barostat or plotting implementation details.

Open items:

- Add rendered page snapshots after the hidden website draft deploys.
- Add an argon/kUPS NPT diagnostic before treating this post as final. The
  current scalar model isolates fluctuation and memory concepts, but it does
  not yet exercise actual MD cell degrees of freedom.

## Scientific Review

- The full profile compares scalar barostat relaxation times `0.5`, `2.0`, and
  `8.0` at target pressure `1.0`, volume `1000`, compressibility `0.01`, and
  `kT = 1`.
- Full-profile volume and pressure variance estimates are within about 15% of
  the analytical targets.
- Volume autocorrelation time increases from about `2.0` for the fast barostat
  to about `22.5` for the slow barostat, supporting the claim that barostat
  time constants change memory and effective sampling.
- The smoke profile uses fewer samples; verification tolerances are deliberately
  wider for fluctuation variance than for the full scientific review.

Open items:

- The website prose should not imply that pressure itself is tightly controlled
  instant by instant. Pressure fluctuations are the signal in small-system NPT.
- The final article should discuss isotropic versus flexible-cell coupling and
  finite-size effects using an actual argon/kUPS workflow.

## Figure Snapshot Review

Snapshot reviewed:

- `snapshots/post-05/barostat_diagnostics_snapshot.png`
- `snapshots/post-05/barostat_diagnostics_full_snapshot.png`

Feedback loop:

- First full-profile pass: labels are readable, target lines are visible in the
  volume and pressure panels, and the autocorrelation panel clearly increases
  with relaxation time.
- The figure does not yet show anisotropic/flexible-cell behavior. That is
  acceptable for this scalar draft, but the final post should add a real cell
  diagnostic if flexible-cell claims are made.

Open items:

- Recheck mobile rendering after the website draft exists.
- Add a production-cell figure after argon/kUPS NPT diagnostics are implemented.

## Notebook Review

- `notebooks/post-05-barostats.ipynb` executes from a clean kernel.
- The notebook loads both smoke and full configurations, displays committed
  outputs, and regenerates the full-profile diagnostic figure from committed
  result files.
- The notebook keeps the explanation focused on pressure fluctuations and cell
  memory rather than becoming the implementation source.

Open items:

- Add the full prose article in the website repository.
- Add citations for NPT ensemble fluctuations, compressibility relations,
  barostat coupling, and finite-size pressure fluctuations when writing the
  website draft.

## Website Draft Review

- Added a hidden draft page in `../sungsoo-ahn.github.io` at
  `https://sungsoo-ahn.github.io/kups-md-tutorials/post-05-barostats/`.
- The page uses the website `post` layout, `nav: false`, the shared
  `kups-md-tutorials` series metadata, and links back to the executable config,
  notebook, smoke/full summaries, full manifest, and review note.
- Copied the reviewed full-profile SVG figure to
  `assets/img/blog/kups_md_post05_barostat_diagnostics.svg`.
- `python3 scripts/validate_blog.py` passes with pre-existing unused-image
  warnings in the website repository.

Open items:

- Capture and inspect deployed desktop and mobile snapshots for this hidden
  page.
- Expand the draft into the full 3,500-10,000-word article after rendered page
  snapshots and the argon/kUPS NPT diagnostic are reviewed.
